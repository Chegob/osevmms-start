<h1>About Us</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>OSE is established by the Government of Oromia National 
    Regional State (ONRS) by Regulation No 108/2007 to 
    fulfill the region’s and country’s seed demands.  
    OSE was established to ensure the fast and sustainable
     economic development through the implementation of 
     agricultural and rural development policy and strategy of 
     the country. (State, OSE Establishment Regulation, 
     2008)</p>
<p>OSE has a leading vision “to be chosen and leading 
    seed Business Company in Africa”. Its mission 
    includes production, processing and supplying 
    improved and market-oriented seeds of food and 
    forage crops to farmers and agro-pastoralist. 
    It also provides a technical support for 
    strengthening and building the small-scale farmers’ 
    capacity for the production & commercialization of 
    quality seeds in the region. (OSE's BPR & BSC 
    Documents, 2012).</p>
<p>As public enterprise, OSE has double responsibilities
     of fulfilling its mission obligation as well as 
     operate as commercial entity (State, 2013). 
     Besides the strategic thinking of seed production, 
     processing and sales of seed vehicle maintenance 
     management is also one of the critical issues as 
     without the advanced garage for it’s different 
     types of vehicles (cars, buses, tractors and other 
     trucks) (Tilahun & Tamene, 2018) it is impossible 
     to achieve the set vision and mission.</p>
<p>The success of OSE is determined largely by 
    organization’s which includes the effectiveness of 
    the operation to achieve its objectives & 
    machineries (tractors, combine harvesters, 
    truckers, cars, etc.) maintained well and made ready
     for the operations timely (Tilahun & Tamene, 2018).</p>
<p>Its head quarter located at Finfinne (AA) OSE has 
    three branches fully operational: Arsi, Bale & West 
    Oromia branches (Abdo, 2018). OSE is governed by 
    Board of Directors & General Manager who assigned by
     the Board . It has administrative and technical 
     staffs. It has five processes (i.e. Production & 
     Processing & Sales Main Process, Seed Information 
     Technology Advisory Main Process & Human Resource 
     Management Support Process, Planning, Budgeting, 
     Reporting & Feedback Support Process, and Material 
     Supply & Finance Service Support Process) and two 
     services (Legal Service Process and Audit & 
     Inspection Service Process) .  Vehicle maintenance 
     is under the Material Supply & Finance Service 
     Support Process. Currently OSE has its well 
     organized garages at Arsi and Bale Branches and 
     ten farms. (Tilahun, Ato, 2018) From what has been 
     said so far it is easy to see how much it is 
     important to have modern automated Vehicle 
     Maintenance Management  system.</p>
